# Origami

### Models
I've been folding origami for over a decade now, and over time I've been able to become skilled enough to fold some great models. Here are some of my favorites from my [origami instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/maxwelljonesorigami/)

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Fluffy.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Buddha.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Owl.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

### Teaching
I've been teaching origami since I was in middle school. Here are some pics of me teaching from when I was younger:

# Basketball

I've been playing basketball since around second grade, and I currently play club
basketball at CMU. One of my big goals for basketball was being able to dunk. Here's a video of
me dunking :\)
