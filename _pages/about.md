I'm currently a first year PhD student at CMU in the Machine Learning Department in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jun-Yan Zhu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~junyanz/). I'm also a [Rales Fellow](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/funding/rales/index.html) at CMU in the inagural 2024 cohort. 

In the past, I was a Masters of Machine Learning student at CMU and an AI and Math double major at CMU. As a masters student, I was honored to be selected as a [Siebel Scholar](https://csd.cmu.edu/news/five-scs-students-named-2024-siebel-scholars). As an undergrad, I was awarded [The Mark Stehlik Introductory and Service Teaching Award](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scsfacts/stehlikaward.html) for my work teaching [discrete mathematics](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~jmackey/151_128/recitations.html).

My research interests include generative modeling for vision and visual tasks, as well as multimodal machine learning in the generative modeling space. 

On the fun side, I love sports, and like to play basketball, volleyball, ping pong, and pickleball. I also like doing origami, and I've been folding since I was very young.
