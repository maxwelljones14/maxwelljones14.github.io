[[Codebase]](https://github.com/maxwelljones14/Origami_Social_Networking)

The idea of this project was to create a platform that origamists could share their work
with each other and also share models that they made with each other along with
instructions. It was coded up my senior year of high school, 2018-2019

# Implementation

I first added a login feature with hashing passwords using MD5 so users can be authenticated in
a secure manner in the backend. From here, users can look at the designs of their freinds,
add their own designs, and create new designs via a python program embedded into the webpage.
